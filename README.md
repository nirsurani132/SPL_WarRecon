# C++ Assignment

This repository contains a C++ assignment that I wrote and solved as part of my work as a TA in the **Systems Programming Language** course at **Ben-Gurion University of the Negev**. The course is aimed at second-year students and focuses on developing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** skills and proper **memory management** techniques.

## Objective
The main objective of this assignment is to help students:
- Enhance their understanding of OOP concepts in C++
- Practice memory handling, including dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- Write larger-scale projects than they are typically used to

## Structure
- **Source Code**: The core of the assignment, demonstrating various OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Unit Tests**: Implemented using the **Google Test** framework (`gtest`). These tests cover different edge cases and functionality, ensuring the robustness of the solution.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Output Tests**: Comprehensive output tests to simulate complete runs of the assignment, verifying both functionality and correct program behavior.

## Tools and Technologies
- **C++**: The programming language used for the assignment.
- **gtest**: Unit testing framework for C++.
- **E2E Tests**: Custom test scripts to validate the final output of the program.

## Purpose
This assignment is designed to challenge students to think critically and to improve their proficiency in **OOP** and **memory management**. Through this task, students gain practical experience in writing efficient, clean, and well-structured C++ code, preparing them for more advanced projects.
